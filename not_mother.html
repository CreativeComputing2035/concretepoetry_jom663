    <h1>That's not our mother</h1>
    <p>“You’re not our mother!” the girl cried. “Your hand is covered with fur. You are a tiger!”
    </p>
    <p>The tiger broke the door and the children ran out the back door and climbed a tree next to the well. “How did you get in there?” the tiger demanded, looking at the reflection of the children in the well. The children laughed and said, “We are up here in the tree."</p>
    <p>The tiger asked "How do you climb up there?"</p>
   
    <h2>What will the children do?</h2>
