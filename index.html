    <h1>Concrete Poetry Choose your own adventure</h1>
    <p>A woman went to help a neighbor and told her son and daughter, “While I’m away, be very careful not to open the door to any strangers.”She helped her neighbor in his field all day and earned some millet to make pancakes with. On her way back home, the woman was stopped by a fierce tiger.
    </p>
    <p>“Give me something to eat,” the tiger said, “or I will eat you.” </p>
    <h2>What will the mother do?</h2>
