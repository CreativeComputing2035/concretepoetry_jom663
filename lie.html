    <p> If you want to climb up here, pour oil on the tree,” the boy said. “That makes it easy to climb.”

    <p>The tiger ran off and found some oil. He covered the tree trunk with the oil, but the tree was now even more slippery. He fell to the ground. “How clever you are! I give up. But just tell me how did you really get so high up the tree?” the tiger said in a flattering way.</p>


    <p>“We took the axe,” the boy said proudly. “We chopped holes for our feet in the trunk of the tree,” the girl added.</p>
    
    <p>
The cunning tiger laughed and got an ax. The children now realized how foolish they had been and began to pray. The Lord of Heaven heard their prayer and immediately sent down a strong rope with a pail at the bottom. The children quickly sat in the pail and pulled upward.</p>
