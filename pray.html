    <h1>Pray as the children did</h1>
    <p>When the tiger reached the top of the tree, he also prayed. The Lord of Heaven heard the tiger’s prayer, but this time, he sent down a rotten rope with a pail at the bottom. In his hurry, the tiger quickly sat in the pail and pulled upward.</p>

    <p>The rotten rope could not carry the tiger’s weight, and it broke. The tiger fell and landed in an old millet field. The tiger’s body was pierced by the sharp millet stalks, and they were covered by his blood. This is why millet is red.</p>


    <p>When the children reached Heaven, the Lord made the young girl become the sun because she was shy. That way, no one would ever be able to look at her directly.</p>
